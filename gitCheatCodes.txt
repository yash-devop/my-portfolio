1. git init
2. if we already have a repo , then just clone it or remote it
    git clone <http link here>

    or

    git remote add origin httplinkhere.

3. now to change the master to main 

    use :  git branch -m master main

4. to create a new branch , 
type : git switch -c newBranch

or

git checkout -m newBranch

5. To push that branch to Github.com

        git push --set-upstream origin yourBranchName

6. to push the BRANCH or to ATTACH THE branch to the MAINbranch

        git 

7. to switch from BRANCH To main

    git checkout main

8. a. TO delete the Branch Locally :
    git branch -d branchName

   b. to delete the branch REMOTELY ( means from Github.com/repo also)

    git push origin :branchName

9. if CRLF error comes 
paste this :   git config --global core.autocrlf true


10. how to now push  the created branch in to the MAIN/MASTER branch: 

    git checkout main    -->  to put the head to the main branch
    git pull origin main    -->  to have uptodate
    git merge branch-name      --> to merget that branchname to the main branch.
    git push origin main     --> push to the main branch.
